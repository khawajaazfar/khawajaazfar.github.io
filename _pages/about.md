* Aspiring Ph.D. student, currently working as Machine Learning Engineer at [Dubizzle Labs](https://www.dubizzlelabs.com/).


* I received my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from [Lahore Garrison University](https://lgu.edu.pk/) in 2024.<br>
During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working under the supervision of [Prof. Rafaqat Alam Khan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=spYkiD8AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focused on Computer Vision using Deep Learning, which provided me with a strong foundation in Skills Gained, e.g., CNN, NLP, RNN, ANN.
