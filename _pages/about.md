* Aspiring Ph.D. student, currently working as Machine Learning Engineer at [Dubizzle Labs](https://www.dubizzlelabs.com/).

<!-- * I received my master's degree at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), advised by [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ). -->

<!-- * I was a visiting research student in [CCVL](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/) group at Johns Hopkins University in 2019. <br>
I worked closely with [Prof. Alan Yuille](www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) and [Dr. Weichao Qiu](https://weichaoqiu.com/). -->

* I received my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from [Lahore Garrison University](https://lgu.edu.pk/) in 2024.<br>
During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working under the supervision of [Prof. Rafaqat Alam Khan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=spYkiD8AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focused on Computer Vision using Deep Learning, which provided me with a strong foundation in Skills Gained, e.g., CNN, NLP, RNN, ANN.
